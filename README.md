# Mathematical expression analyzer
> Behind a bigger project, a custom programming language.
Here I am implementing a basic lexer, parser and usage of an Abstract Syntax Tree.


Basic usage:

Clone the repo:
```
https://github.com/Ironowl1907/MathExpressionEvaluator.git
```
Compile the project:
Note: Makefile is using the g++ compiler.
```
cd MathExpressionEvaluator && make
```
Run the outputted binary:
```
./final.out
'''
